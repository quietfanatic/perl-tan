Outline of current ideas:
- nerdy glasses
- Perl is quick, small, ugly -- so long legs, short stature, not especially visually appealling?  Has to still be moé though.
  - Mini-skirt maid outfit to highlight long legs?
- Sigil earrings?

Perl 5 specific:
To be expanded.
- Hair color, style?
- Eye color, style?
- Something to represent CPAN.  Always reading books?
  - The books would be named using CPAN's typical syntax: Foo::Bar...
  - She would have a library card or tote bag labeled "CPAN"
    - A visit to the library would reveal it divided up into sections according to
      the typical syntax of a CPAN module's name

Perl 6 specific:
- relation to official mascot at http://perl6.org/ possibly wings or hairstyle
  - Perhaps work the official mascot into the eye color as well.
- various mascots corresponding to different implementations (parrot, etc.)
  - To start with, she would have a parrot on her shoulder represnting that virtual machine.
  - Since there will likely be many implementations in the future, leave room for others to be added.
- Also Perl 6 is somewhat of a dojikko and works slowly and stumbles a lot. But she's still learning.



There are some prior designs for programming-language-tans from Japanland:

(Cannot guarantee worksafeness of the latter site or links from either)

Here are a bunch of different maid looks that may be helpful.  I got the miniskirt idea from the center (Rin) here.
