Outline of current ideas:
- nerdy glasses
- Perl is quick, small, ugly -- so long legs, short stature, not especially visually appealling?  Has to still be mo√© though.
  - Mini-skirt maid outfit to highlight long legs?

Perl 5 specific:
To be expanded.
- Hair color, style?
- Eye color, style?
- Something to represent CPAN.  Always reading books?

Perl 6 specific:
- relation to official mascot at http://perl6.org/ possibly wings or hairstyle
  - Perhaps work the official mascot into the eye color as well.
- various mascots corresponding to different implementations (parrot, etc.)
  - To start with, she would have a parrot on her shoulder represnting that virtual machine.
  - Since there will likely be many implementations in the future, leave room for others to be added.
- Also Perl 6 is somewhat of a dojikko and works slowly and stumbles a lot. But she's still learning.
