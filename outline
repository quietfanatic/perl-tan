Outline of current ideas:

- nerdy glasses
- Perl is quick, small, ugly -- so long legs, short stature, not especially visually appealling?  Has to still be mo√© though.

Perl 6 specific:
- relation to official mascot at http://perl6.org/ possibly wings or hairstyle
- various mascots corresponding to different implementations (parrot, etc.)
