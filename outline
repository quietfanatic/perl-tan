Outline of current ideas:
- nerdy glasses
- Perl is quick, small, ugly -- so long legs, short stature, not especially
  visually appealling?  Has to still be moé though.
  - Mini-skirt maid outfit to highlight long legs?
  - It occurs to me that the speed of Perl is primarily that of developing
    applications quickly rather than running quickly.  I mean, it runs plenty
    fast compar ed to say Ruby or PHP, but is a slug compared to compiled
    languages like C.  I don't know if this would affect the design or not.
- Sigil earrings?
- The O'Reilly Perl books have traditionally been a blue, almost teal color.
  I'm thinking this color should feature on either her regular outfit or her
  maid outfit.  Since the O'Reilly books are a more formal medium they remind
  me more of a maid uniform.
- Slightly above shoulder length hair.

Perl 5 specific:
To be expanded.
- Hair color, style?
  - Ideas: twintails at top of head, twintails at neck.
- Eye color, style?
  - Reporting based on prior artwork, there seem to be two different hair
    styles: medium-length loose hair and medium-length twintails tied in
    various styles with some sort of spherical ornament.  These aren't mutually
    exclusive of course, they could be two different ways of tying the same
    hair.
  - In terms of colors, in almost all artwork I (quietfanatic) have found she
    has grey hair and red eyes (often matching a red dress).  I don't know if
    it means anything but that's the trend, and for lack of better ideas I
    wouldn't mind following it.
- Smaller bow, twin "tails" down to feet to add a vertical balance.
- Something to represent CPAN.  Always reading books?
  - The books would be named using CPAN's typical syntax: Foo::Bar...
  - She would have a library card or tote bag labeled "CPAN"
    - A visit to the library would reveal it divided up into sections according
      to the typical syntax of a CPAN module's name

Perl 6 specific:
- relation to official mascot at http://perl6.org/ possibly wings or hairstyle
  - Perhaps work the official mascot into the eye color as well.
  - Giant bow that looks like wings, twin "tails" descending to feet.
  - Hair matching butterfly?
- various mascots corresponding to different implementations (parrot, etc.)
  - To start with, she would have a parrot on her shoulder represnting that
    virtual machine.
  - Since there will likely be many implementations in the future, leave room
  for others to be added.
- Also Perl 6 is somewhat of a dojikko and works slowly and stumbles a lot. But
  she's still learning.



There are some prior designs for programming-language-tans from Japanland:

(Cannot guarantee worksafeness of the latter site or links from either)

Here are a bunch of different maid looks that may be helpful.  I got the
miniskirt idea from the center (Rin) here.
